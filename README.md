Welcome to our project exploring the correlation between hypomanic personality and executive control.
Details on how the experiment was designed and executed can be found in our [pregregistration](preregistration.pdf) and our [poster](HPEC_poster.pdf).
The images used were taken from the [OASIS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26907748/) and our total data collected can be found [here](data_Pavlovia).
Note that the [analysis](entire_script.Rmd) excludes data that didn't violate the criteria in our preregistration.
